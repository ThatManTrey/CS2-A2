# CS2-A2
A2 Report - Trey Phillips, 2018

For this assignment, I broke the programming process into steps. I wrote the basic program without 
outputing to a file and using the STL stack. I also refrained from doing any calculations required
in the prompt that wouldn't help complete the factorial calculation. Once I was able to get the first
dozen factorials calculated, I debugged and reassessed the algorithm continuously until I could
successfully calculate 100!. This is when I began implementing the linked stack, adding additional
calculations, and timing the processes by using the <ctime> library. Once this was all tweaked to my liking,
I tested bigger values.

The biggest factorial I calculated was 1,000,000!, which took about two and a half hours. I attempted to calculate bigger numbers,
but due to time I halted these processes. I speculated during the program development that my program
would run faster than normal and be able to calculate bigger numbers, mostly due to the fact that my PC
has the following specifications:
Intel i7 7700K CPU, overclocked at roughly 4.5 GHz
16GB, DDR4 SRAM
On any other computer, the program would probably run at a similar speed and have similar limitations.
